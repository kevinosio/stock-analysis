##Summary

There are both Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code. An advantage of refactoring is to make a code that was cluttered and slow more efficient. A downside of refactoring is that in the process of making a project more efficient you could break the project.
The pros and cons above to apply to the original vba code and the new. The code does run faster now but I did spend a little bit of time to trouble shoot it.
